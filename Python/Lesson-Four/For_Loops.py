#Lets create a basic for loop that counts from 1 to 10

for i in range(1,11):
	print "The for loop has looped through: " + str(i)

print "Lets try making the range in a different way"
#this for loop will loop through 10 times (0 to 9)

for i in range(10):
	print "The for loop has looped through: " + str(i)
