#these are called comments

#They are used to explain what your code is doing
#They don't actually effect anyhting in the code

#To make a comment you just need to use the # like this
#everything on the same line after the # doesn't do anything

#comments are good

#
# This is another example of a comment
# anything between the slashes is a comment
# and you can use as many lines as youd like
#
#
# none of this writing will try to run
#

# even if I tried typing actual lines of code in a comment they wouldn't run
#print "Hello World"
#still nothing happens
